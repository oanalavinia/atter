      <h2>Abstract</h2>
      <p>
            Atter is an application designed for students of Computer Science Faculty of Iasi that has as a purpose the implementation of a 
            system that manages the courses and seminars. Users are of two types, teachers that can register a seminar/course, add marks,
             notes for students and visualise different reports, and the students that can attend a seminar/course and also see some 
             informations provided by the teacher.

    <section id="functional">
      <h2>Functional part</h2>
      <p>
          The functionalities of the application are structured so each step of the interaction will be in fact a module:
      </p>
      <section id="login">
        <!-- review? -->
        <h3>Login</h3>
        <p>
            The login is made based on the fenrir account provided by the faculty, so each user can be directed to the specific interface that matches his account.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="attendRegister">
        <!-- review? -->
        <h3>Attend/Register class</h3>
        <p>
            To avoid the cases where a student could sign another one as being present we added in this module the functionality where the teacher will provide some information about a class when it is registered and will receive in return a code that will be used by students to attend a class. Another information worth mentioning is the fact that the teacher also provides the number of students that are present.

                    <p>
                        Prototype allows us to hide the complexity of making new instances from the client. The concept is to copy an existing object rather than creating a new instance from scratch, something that may include 
                        costly operations. The existing object acts as a prototype and contains the state of the object. The newly copied object may change same properties only if required. This approach saves costly resources and time, especially when the object creation is a heavy process.                            
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        JavaScript modules are the most prevalently used design patterns for keeping particular pieces of code independent of other components. This provides loose coupling to support well-structured code.

                    <p>
                        In this application context the modules pattern will be implemented by having a specific module for login, attendClass, registerClass, checkCourses, logout

                                Firebase Realtime Database is a NoSQL database and as such has different optimizations and functionalities, such as the possibility to use it as a REST endpoint. All we need to do is append .json to the end of the URL and send a request from our HTTPS client.

                <h4>Database storage</h4>
                <p>
                    For storing the data we use the Firebase Realtime Database which is a cloud-hosted NoSql database. Data is stored as a JSON tree and synchronized in realtime to every connected client.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Firebase Realtime Database allows secure access to the database directly from client-side code. Data is persisted locally, and even while offline, realtime events continue to fire, giving the end user a responsive experience. When the device regains connection, the Realtime Database synchronizes the local data changes with the remote updates that occurred while the client was offline, merging any conflicts automatically.
