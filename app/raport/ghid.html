        <p property="text">
            The register component is available for students and professors, but with different functionalities.
            The way it monitors the attendance at the seminars is embedded around the fact that the teacher receives 
            the code associated with that week when he / she generates a course. By providing this code to the students 
            it is assured that only the present can have access to it. 
            But as additional measures the application checkes the location of each student wishing to attend a seminar so that 
            he can not do it if he / she is outside the faculty. It is also not allowed to register after the seminar hours.
